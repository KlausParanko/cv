        <h2 class="job-title">Software Engineer & Data Scientist</h2>
        <p>
          I recently graduated with a master's from the prestigious Aalto School of Business, majoring in Finance and
          minoring in Data Science. As my studies progressed I realized I really enjoy programming and computer
          science. From that point onward I directed my studies towards data science, and started
          self-learning everything about computers and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to create something out of basically nothing through code. I am also fascinated by the
          magic of how everything we use on a computer, no matter how complex, eventually boils down to simply zeroes
          and ones. I use linux as my daily driver,
          awesomewm as my window manager, and
          neovim as my editor of choice (although I do have plenty of experience with
          vscode).
        <p>As a person I am open-minded and tend to get along with everyone. I
          enjoy different cultures, and have lived in Vietnam and Australia. I am always learning about one subject or
          another, whether it is through youtube videos, books, or online courses. I am an avid
          gym-goer, and have been doing so since I was 15 years old.</p>

          <p>For my thesis I gathered a novel dataset of company 8K reports using Python and applied state-of-the-art
            deep
            learning
            algorithms to find relationships between the content of the reports and the reporting companies' stock price
            movements. The thesis demonstrated my ability to work independently, as other than the statistical analysis
            part and the domain area, the skills required were not part of my major's curriculum. Afterwards, I gave the
            dataset to a phd student of my advisor, who asked if he could use it for his own research.
            The grade I got for the work was 5/5.</p>

          <p>For my bachelor's thesis I studied whether attention companies receive as measured by the amount of Google
            searches correlates with their price movements. I used Python to gather the data from the Google Trends API
            and matched this to price data of companies from CRSP. The grade I received was 4/5.</p>

          <h4>Stack: Python (Pandas), Typescript (React, D3)</h4>
          <p>The application takes my Nordea income statement as input and parses this into a database. It also
            automatically categorizes my transactions into chosen categories. The ones it can't automatically categorize
            it provides an efficient ui for manual categorization. The app then vizualises the data. </p>

          <h4>Stack: Python (Pandas), Typescript (React, D3)</h4>
          <p>I scrape the Talented Top 50 Places to Work in Tech. I then use the Orbis database to get accounting
            information for these companies, e.g. revenue, operating profit, net income, and employee count, all for the
            past 5 years. I further use the industry classification to find all other Finnish companies within the same
            industries and get the same financial data for them to expand the companies covered by my analysis. I
            wrangle the data and visualize my main findings from it. </p>
