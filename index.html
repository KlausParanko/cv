        <h2 class="job-title">Data Engineer & Analyst</h2>
        <p>
          I recently graduated with a master's from Aalto University, majoring in Finance and
          minoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. As my studies progressed and we had
          our first programming course, I realized I
          really enjoy programming and computer
          science. From that point onward I directed my studies towards data science, and started
          self-learning everything about computers and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to bring order into chaos by taking messy and complex raw data and turning it into
          understandable clean
          data. I also enjoy discovering the patterns underlying the data, which often open interesting and useful
          windows into
          real world phenomena. In programming I enjoy taking a process, figuring out the best way to do it once, and
          from
          there on letting the computer do it for me through automation. I am also fascinated by the
          magic of how everything we use on a computer, no matter how complex, eventually boils down to simply zeroes
          and ones. I use linux as my daily driver,
          awesomewm as my window manager, and
          neovim as my editor of choice (although I do have plenty of experience with
          vscode).
        <p>As a person I am open-minded and tend to get along with everyone. I
          enjoy different cultures, and have lived in Vietnam and Australia. I am always learning about one subject or
          another, whether it is through youtube videos, books, or online courses. I am also an avid
          gym-goer, and have been doing so since I was 15 years old.</p>

          <p>For my thesis I gathered a novel dataset of company 8K reports using Python and applied state-of-the-art
            deep
            learning
            algorithms to find relationships between the content of the reports and the reporting companies' stock price
            movements. Gathering the dataset included automating making requests for the 8K reports, cleaning the data,
            and parsing the reports (which were originally intended for human consumption) into a structured form that
            could be
            statistically analyzed. Afterwards, I gave the
            dataset to a phd student of my advisor, who asked if he could use it for his own research.
            The grade I got for the work was 5/5.</p>

          <p>For my bachelor's thesis I studied whether attention companies receive as measured by the amount of Google
            searches correlates with their price movements. I used Python to gather the data from the Google Trends API
            and matched this to price data of companies from CRSP. The grade I received was 4/5.</p>

          <h3>Finnish Tech Market Analysis</h3>
          <h4>Stack: Python, Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake), and Power BI</h4>
          <p>The purpose for this project is to get know Finnish tech landscape from the perspective of a job seeker. I
            do this by analysing both tech
            company financials and job postings for data engineering roles
            . The questions I answer from the financials dataset is which companies are
            financially profitable, which ones are least risky regarding their debt amount, and which ones are hiring
            (have a increasing employee count). From the job postings I analyze which technologies have the most demand
            from data engineering recruiters. I also combine the datasets to rank the job postings by the financial
            success of the recruiting company. I get the financials from the Orbis database and the job postings by
            scraping LinkedIn jobs by creating a
            Python web scraping script. I parse both datasets into
            a structured form using python. I then upload these to a database in Databricks. To answer my questions I
            analyze the datasets
            using PySpark
            and create data visualizations using Power BI. </p>

          <h3>My Financial and Fitness Data</h3>
          <h4>Stack: Python, Snowflake, and Power BI</h4>
          <p> I look at two things in this project: my financials (money coming in/going out) and my fitness (calories
            coming in/going out, amount of sleep). The purpose is to analyze the data and see if there are things I am
            spending a lot of money on that provide me little value, or if I am eating things that are not that
            enjoyable but contribute a lot of calories. I also look at the interplay of my health and financials, like
            do I spend more money on days I haven't slept well. I also want to automate this as much as possible, so
            that it is
            easy to look at on a monthly basis. I get my
            financials
            from downloading my transaction log from Nordea and parsing the details with Python. I get my calorie
            consumption and sleep amount from my Fitbit wristband from Fitbit's website as a csv, which I parse for
            relevant info using Python. I get my calorie consumption from my calorie diary app FatSecret as a csv. I
            store the data in a Snowflake database. I analyze the data with SQL queries
            and visualize the results with Power BI. </p>
