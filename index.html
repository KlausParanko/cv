        <h2 class="job-title">Data Engineer & Analyst</h2>
        <p>
          I recently graduated with a master's from Aalto University, majoring in statistics-focused Finance and
          minoring in "Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence." As my studies progressed I realized
          I really like the data side and programming. From that point on I directed my studies towards data science,
          and started
          self-learning everything about computers and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to bring order into chaos by taking messy and complex raw data and turning it into
          understandable clean
          data. I also enjoy discovering the patterns underlying the data, which often open interesting and useful
          windows into
          real world phenomena. In programming I enjoy taking a process, figuring out the best way to do it once, and
          from
          there on letting the computer do it for me through automation. I am also fascinated by the
          magic of how everything we use on a computer, no matter how complex, eventually boils down to simply zeroes
          and ones.
        </p>
        <p>I use linux as my daily driver and enjoy using the command line. I use neovim as my editor of
          choice, although I am happy working in any environment (eg. the Snowflake/Databricks UIs)
        <p>As a person I am open-minded and tend to get along with everyone. I
          enjoy different cultures, and have lived in Vietnam and Australia. I am always learning about one subject or
          another, whether it is through youtube videos, books, or online courses. I am also an avid
          gym-goer, and have been doing so since I was 15 years old.</p>

          <h3>Sentiment Analysis on Company 8K Reports Using a Large Language Model </h3>
          <h4>Stack</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Data Wrangling: Python/Pandas</li>
            <li>Large Language Models: Python/HuggingFace</li>

          </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>For my master's thesis I gathered a novel dataset of company 8K reports using Python and applied
            sentiment analysis to the text of the reports using a large language model similar to ChatGPT. I combined
            this with the companies' stock data and found
            relationships between the release of the reports, their text content's sentiment, and the reporting
            companies' stock
            price
            movements. Afterwards, I gave the
            dataset to a phd student of my advisor, who asked if he could use it for his own research.
            The grade I got for the work was 5/5.</p>

          <p>For my bachelor's thesis I studied whether attention companies receive as measured by the amount of
            Google
            searches correlates with their price movements. I used Python to gather the data from the Google Trends
            API
            and matched this to price data of companies from CRSP. The grade I received was 4/5.</p>
