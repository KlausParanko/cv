        <h2 class="job-title">Data Engineer & Analyst</h2>
        <p>
          I recently graduated with a master's from Aalto University, majoring in Finance and
          minoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. As my studies progressed and we had
          our first programming course, I realized I
          really enjoy programming and computer
          science. From that point onward I directed my studies towards data science, and started
          self-learning everything about computers and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to bring order into chaos by taking messy and complex raw data and turning it into
          understandable clean
          data. I also enjoy discovering the patterns underlying the data, which often open interesting and useful
          windows into
          real world phenomena. In programming I enjoy taking a process, figuring out the best way to do it once, and
          from
          there on letting the computer do it for me through automation. I am also fascinated by the
          magic of how everything we use on a computer, no matter how complex, eventually boils down to simply zeroes
          and ones. I use linux as my daily driver,
          awesomewm as my window manager, and
          neovim as my editor of choice (although I do have plenty of experience with
          vscode).
        <p>As a person I am open-minded and tend to get along with everyone. I
          enjoy different cultures, and have lived in Vietnam and Australia. I am always learning about one subject or
          another, whether it is through youtube videos, books, or online courses. I am also an avid
          gym-goer, and have been doing so since I was 15 years old.</p>

          <p>For my thesis I gathered a novel dataset of company 8K reports using Python and applied state-of-the-art
            deep
            learning
            algorithms to find relationships between the content of the reports and the reporting companies' stock price
            movements. Gathering the dataset included automating making requests for the 8K reports, cleaning the data,
            and parsing the reports (which were intended for human consumption) into a structured form that could be
            statistically analyzed. Afterwards, I gave the
            dataset to a phd student of my advisor, who asked if he could use it for his own research.
            The grade I got for the work was 5/5.</p>

          <p>For my bachelor's thesis I studied whether attention companies receive as measured by the amount of Google
            searches correlates with their price movements. I used Python to gather the data from the Google Trends API
            and matched this to price data of companies from CRSP. The grade I received was 4/5.</p>

            interesting for other people too.</h4>
          <h4>Stack: Python (Pandas), Typescript (React, D3)</h4>
          <p>I scrape the Talented Top 50 Places to Work in Tech. I then use the Orbis database to get accounting
            information for these companies for the past 5 years, e.g. revenue, operating profit, net income, and
            employee count. I further use the industry classification to find all other Finnish companies within the
            same
            industries and get the same financial data for them to expand the companies covered by my analysis. I
            wrangle the data, analze it and visualize my main findings from it. </p>
